# Exercise 2 — Bitwise Flag Manipulation

You are given an integer representing a set of flags.  
Perform the following operations:

1. **Set bit 2**  
2. **Clear bit 1**  
3. **Toggle bit 0**

Print the value after each operation.

## Bit positions
- Bit 0 → 1  
- Bit 1 → 2  
- Bit 2 → 4  

## Example
If the input is `3` (binary `011`):

- Set bit 2 → `111` → 7  
- Clear bit 1 → `101` → 5  
- Toggle bit 0 → `100` → 4
